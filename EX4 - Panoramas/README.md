The provided code implements various functions for feature detection and matching in computer vision using
the Harris corner detector and RANSAC algorithm.

It includes functions for detecting Harris corners, sampling descriptors, matching features,
applying homography transformations, and visualizing the results.

Additionally, it provides functions for warping images based on homography matrices.
These functions are useful for tasks such as image stitching and object recognition.
