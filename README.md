# Image-Processing-
During the Introduction to Image Processing course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I worked on diverse projects that covered various aspects of the field. In this repository, you will find these projects, which demonstrate my learning and practical application of image processing techniques.

Here are the main goals of each exercise:

Ex1: Histogram equalization and quantization of grayscale images.

Ex2: Changing the rates of WAV files using Fourier transformations. 

Ex3: Blending images using Laplacian and Gaussian pyramids techniques.

Ex4: Creating panoramic images from a video using the Harris corner detector and RANSAC algorithms. 

Ex5: Exploring the use of neural networks for image processing tasks.

These exercises provided me with valuable hands-on experience and deepened my understanding of image processing techniques in practical applications.
